### A note on naming
Remember when we said that you can not use one of the **reserved** words for a **name**.  If not, go back to the [Rcel](rcel.html) exercise.  
However, you also need to be careful with things like `c` that *not* reserved words when naming functions.  Try the following:

Separate **namespaces** for functions and ... 

```{r}
c <- function() {}
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
c(1,2,3)     # Uh oh.
```
